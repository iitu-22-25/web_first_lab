                I was born in 2004 in Almaty city, Kazakhstan.
                My hobbies are oil drawing, playing guitar and writing some interesting programs or websites.
                In childhood, I was lazy, slow, I didn't have goals. I felt like I was floating down the river.
                But everything had changed when I started learning programming.
                When I entered college, my world turned upside down. I realized that IT is my place in life.
                I was inspired by new possibilities and new colors appeared in my life.
                I became more open to people and started taking care of real business.
                I taught myself not to give up and go to my goal no matter what.
